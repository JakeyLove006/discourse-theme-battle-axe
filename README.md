# Discourse theme and customizations for Tappara.co

Copyright (c) 2017 Tappara.co. Released under the MIT license.

In this repository we host the visual mods we have developed for Discourse.org. See a live demo at https://tappara.co (Finnish language)

We have sanitized the default view /latest, added minor improvements to /categories and applied a bunch of branding/visual customizations.

One special feature of our theme is the branding of our hosting partner https://upcloud.com. For them we have implemented locally served ads to the header and footer areas. These will not be blocked by generic adblockers, thus providing new commercial opportunities for fellow Discourse admins. These code snippets include a Google Analytics OnClick tracking event, so modify accordingly

Due to the structure of the customization functinality, the mods consist of several files. You will need to copy & paste the content **all** of these files to the appropriate fields in Discourse admin/customize/css_html.

If you find this theme useful, a link back to https://tappara.co is appreciated.
