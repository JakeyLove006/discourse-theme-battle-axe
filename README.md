# Discourse customizations for Tappara.co

In this repository we host the visual mods we have developed for Discourse.org. See a live demo at https://tappara.co (Finnish language)

We have sanitized the default view /latest, added minor improvements to /categories and applied a bunch of branding/visual customizations.

Due to the structure of the customization functinality, the mods consist of several files. You will need to copy & paste the content **all** of these files to the appropriate fields in Discourse admin/customize/css_html.
